#     Chapter 1: Learning R Basics With Swirl              #

#==========================================================#

#to install the package, please run the code below:
#(to run the code, simply click on the line, or select the whole line, and then hit Ctrl+enter or Apple+enter)
install.packages("swirl")

#this way you install the package to your computer. Once you did it, you do not need to install the same
#package every time you reopen R or Rstudio. But, you will need to type library() to be able to use the package 
#every time you reopen your R / RStudio. 

#So, let's load the swirl library using library()

library(swirl)

#OMG, swirl says hi! So, when you are ready to start learning new lessons, just type swirl()

swirl()

#Then swirl will ask what it should call you... What is super nice about swirl is that it kind of talks to you while
#you are learning R. 

#swirl will give you some prompts that explains how to use it. 
#For your reference, I will copy-paste those lines at the end of this Rscript. You are welcome!

#so you can use swirl as your reference to practice R. The first lesson, R Programming, for instance,
#shows how to save your workspace, how to create number sequences, vector, dataframes, and such.

#SWIRL INSTRUCTIONS

#First of all, you
#| should know that when you see '...', that means you should press Enter when you are done reading and ready to
#| continue.

#| Also, when you see 'ANSWER:', the R prompt (>), or when you are asked to select from a list, that means it's your turn
#| to enter a response, then press Enter to continue.

#| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you are already at the
#| prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know
#| you've done so.

#| When you are at the R prompt (>):
#  | -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
#| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
#| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
#| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
#| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
#| -- Typing info() displays these options again.
